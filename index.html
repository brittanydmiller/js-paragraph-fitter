    <h1>Ding. | <span id="tagline">a manual paragraph wrapper</span></h1>
    <p id="description">
      Ding uses JavaScript to make your paragraph any width with custom line breaks! Very exciting. Ding also ensures your final line always has at least two words in it, and logs any possible overflows caused by really long words or really short paragraph-widths.
      
      Notes: Paragraph will be using a mono-spaced font at a character-width of .25 inches. (This was a challenge given to me -- I don't purport to claim Ding is a useful app.)
